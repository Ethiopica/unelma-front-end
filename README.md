This is the frontend part of Unelma project
TEST

Note: after cloning the repository, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Note for Sprint 2

User authentication will connect the frontend and backend. We’ll need to pull the backend repository, run the development server, and log in as an admin.

```bash
php artisan serve
```
